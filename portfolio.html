      <h3>Soap Business Project</h3>
      <p>For a sophomore project, everyone in our grade had to work in groups to create their own business marketing and producing soap. My members and I split up the workload between us. One finished making our floral soap and the packaging with some assistance; another focussed on our marketing strategy and wrote the sales pitch; and I worked on the financial aspect and designed <a href="https://sites.google.com/wcusd.net/euphoria/home?authuser=0">our business' website</a> with Google Sites.</p>

      <h3>"Just My Luck" Game</h3>
      <p>I attempted using Construct for the first time to make a platformer game in 3 days as my submission to <a href="https://showcase.codeday.org/project/ckln325h8154525011qf31aeeswh">Virtual Codeday Winter 2021</a>. It had also been my first time participating in a hackathon-type event. It was a nice learning experience!</p>

      <img id="history" src="assets/history-site.png" alt="A screenshot of my Technology and Globalization website.">
      <h3>History Research Website</h3>
      <p>For US History class, I created another <a href="https://sites.google.com/wcusd.net/technologyandglobalization/home?authuser=0">website</a> but this time, it was for a research project. The goal of the assignment was to answer the unit's inquiry question, "How did the US become an economic superpower?" by researching a sub-topic of our choice. The topic I chose was technology and globalization.</p>

      <h3>Project Smile</h3>
      <p>I am the vice president of Project Smile, my high school's recycling club that my friends and I founded in Sophomore year. In addition to helping the Earth, our club donates all our profit to Operation Smile, an organization which funds surgeries for children with cleft palate.</p>

From left to right, the collage includes a picture of a school environmental art gallery event, a cloudy blue sky from a car's back window view, a school house competition, a gradient sunset in my neighborhood, a soccer game, and an orange tinted sky.">
      <h3>Photography</h3>
      <p>I have been a part of my school's yearbook photography team to capture school events and daily life. I also enjoy taking pictures of beautiful skies.</p>
